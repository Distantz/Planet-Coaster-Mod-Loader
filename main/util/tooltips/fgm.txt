pBaseKeyBrightness = Affects the brightness of the BaseKey color.
pBaseKeyHueRotation = Shifts the coloration of BaseKey from 0.000 to 2.000, shifting from orange-yellow to purple-pink.
pBaseKeySaturation = Affects the saturation of the BaseKey color.
pEnableGlobalColouring = Disables GlobalColouringWeights and uses only the diffuse/colour texture without weights.
pGlobalColouringWeight_00 = Red Tile 1
pGlobalColouringWeight_01 = Green Tile 1
pGlobalColouringWeight_02 = Blue Tile 1
pGlobalColouringWeight_03 = Alpha Tile 1
pGlobalColouringWeight_04 = Red Tile 2
pGlobalColouringWeight_05 = Green Tile 2
pGlobalColouringWeight_06 = Blue Tile 2
pGlobalColouringWeight_07 = Alpha Tile 2
pGlobalColouringWeight_08 = Red Tile 3
pGlobalColouringWeight_09 = Green Tile 3
pGlobalColouringWeight_10 = Blue Tile 3
pGlobalColouringWeight_11 = Alpha Tile 3
pGlobalColouringWeight_12 = Red Tile 4
pGlobalColouringWeight_13 = Green Tile 4
pGlobalColouringWeight_14 = Blue Tile 4
pGlobalColouringWeight_15 = Alpha Tile 4
pKeyColour = Affects where BaseKey attributes affect depending on KeyColourMaskType.
pKeyColourMaskType = Swaps which coloration key affects the dinosaur's primary areas, 0 uses PaletteHeight/PaletteKey and 1 uses BaseKey
pKeyThreshold = Affects how much the dinosaur is affected by RGBA values and coloration methods when KeyColourMaskType is 1
pKeyTolerance = Affects how much the dinosaur is affected by RGBA values and coloration methods when KeyColourMaskType is 0
pMaterialSeed = Unknown Affect
pPaletteHeightComplexity = Alters the coloration of PaletteHeightOffset as according to PaletteHeightSeed, does not affect PaletteKey or BaseKey.
pPaletteHeightOffset = Shifts the coloration of PaletteHeight from 0.000 to 1.000, 0.000 acting as the PaletteHeightSeed color then going around the color wheel until it reaches back to the starting point at 1.000.
pPaletteHeightScale = Affects the distribution of the PaletteHeight coloration, very sensitive to incorrect values.
pPaletteHeightSeed = Changes the color of PaletteHeight randomly, operates on the max possible integer range 0-2147483647.
pPaletteHeightStrength = Affects the intensity of PaletteHeight coloration.
pPaletteKeyBrightness = Affects the brightness of the PaletteKey color.
pPaletteKeyHueRotation = Shifts the coloration of PaletteKey from 0.000 to 2.000, shifting from orange-yellow to purple-pink.
pPaletteKeySaturation = Affects the saturation of the PaletteKey color.
pViewMode = Unknown affect, rarely used
pEnableScreenSpaceAO = Toggles presence of Screen Space Ambient Occlusion
psublayer0diffuseTint = Tints the indicated diffuse layer to the specified RGB value [range 0-1].
AlphaTestRef = The higher this value, the faster transparent materials will fade into becoming invisible as you move away from them.
gWetBrightness = The higher this value, the brighter the diffuse texture becomes when the animal is wet.
pDirtDryColour = RGB that slightly affect the color when the animals are muddy [range 0-1].
pDirtWetColour = RGB that slightly affect the color when the animals are wet [range 0-1].
pRenderLayersOveride = No visible changes.
pTransmittance = Normally 0, a value of 1 makes light go through the object so shadows are removed, but the object remains opaque.
pWetSpecularStrength = Makes the model more reflective while wet independently of the blue value of the roughnesspacked texture.
pMaximumSnowAmount = No visible changes.
pDecayNormalConstrastScale = Affects the intensity of the base normal map (not the detail normals) on the dead body.
pColourMask_HSLGentic0 = Affects Hue, Saturation & Lightness, default is [0.5, 0.5, 0.5].
pColourMask_HSLGentic1 = Affects Hue, Saturation & Lightness, default is [0.5, 0.5, 0.5].
gDirectionScale = Affects growth direction of fur if 0 (use raw normal?), negative (inverted) or positive (as intended). Absolute value seems to have no effect.
gFinBrushScale = Affects direction of fur.
pUseOrenNayar = Use the Orenâ€“Nayar reflectance model, which simulates light on rough / matte natural surfaces better than common shaders such as Lambert.
