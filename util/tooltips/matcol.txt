m_baseColourSaturation = Affects the saturation of this layer's base color map [range 0-1].
m_uvRotationAngle = Affects the rotation of the tiling, blender version is equivelent to -180*this value.
m_uvTile = Affects size of the scale tiles. larger values result in smaller scales.
m_uvRotationPosition = Affects the point at which the rotation of the tiles is performed.
m_uvOffset = Offsets the position of the initial tiling.
m_heightScale = Affects the height strength of the scales. Difference between the min and max values.
m_heightOffset = Offsets the height range of the scales. Offsets both the min and max values.
